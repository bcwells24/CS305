    The client for this project, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company specializing in individualized financial planning, seeking to modernize its operations by enhancing the security of its web application. The company needed to address the critical issue of ensuring secure communication and data integrity when transferring sensitive client financial information. The primary goal was to implement a file verification step and secure the existing application against potential vulnerabilities.

    In identifying and addressing the software security vulnerabilities, analyzing and refactoring of the code were strengths. Recognizing the importance of coding securely is essential, as it prevents data breaches, protects sensitive information, and maintains client trust. Software security directly contributes to a company's overall well-being by safeguarding its reputation and ensuring compliance with industry standards. The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring the integration of security protocols without disrupting the applicationâ€™s functionality. To increase security layers, HTTPS was implemented as well as SHA-256 hashing. Moving forward, I would use automated security tools and continuous integration practices to regularly assess vulnerabilities and apply appropriate mitigation techniques.

    To ensure that the code and software application remained functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing after refactoring, including running the application to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Resources like OWASP Dependency-Check, secure coding practices, and the use of Spring Boot's built-in security features were helpful and will be useful in future assignments. For future employers, I might highlight this project to demonstrate my ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities from a preexisting application, implement encryption protocols, and ensure the secure handling of sensitive data within a web application.
